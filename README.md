## UML

The uml is made using argouml, it's not the best, but it's free and is easy to install/use on ubuntu

NOTE: the uml is likely to not be completely accurate, it more gives an idea as to what each class is meant to do rather than be a source of truth

NOTE 2: I have since switched to using Visual Paradigm, this is because argouml was being a bit weird on my computer, and I was having trouble using it (I'm sure this is due to a bad installation on my part). I have an academic licence for Visual Paradigm, and I know how to use it so I'm going to use that from now on.
